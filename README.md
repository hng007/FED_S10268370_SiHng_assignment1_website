# Assignment 1 Website
my project is based of a game company which i was inspiried to create my own website which allows the user to see all the games that the company made and they can select which game to explore. by clicking on the game they want to explore, they will be brought into another webpage in which they will see a short gameplay clip of the game giving them better understanding of the game and how its played, furthermore it also has a brief explaination of the game and a button which allows the user to click on and allow them to download the game or play it directly if they have the game installed.

## Features
- simple and clear buttons with a clear purpose for the user.
- video clips of gameplay to actract users.
- changing of button colours when mouse hovers on top of it to indicate to user where they are clicking.
